  Net::Whois::RIPE::Syncupdates -- Perl interface to the RIPE Whois Database


  Syncupdates is the facility of the RIPE database to enable updates 
  synchronously, meaning the result is returned immediately to the user. In 
  the other method, asynchronous updates, the update is e-mailed to the 
  server, and the result is e-mailed back.

  This package implements a client to the Syncupdates backend, and can be
  used to send arbitrary updates to the RIPE database.  The package has an 
  object oriented interface which supports the password-based authentication
  scheme, and has hooks via which other authentication methods can be 
  implemented.

  Note that this is BETA code, we are providing it in order to collect
  input from the user community.
